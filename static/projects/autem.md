# Autem Social Analytics, LLC

##### Role: Full Stack Developer

---

Autem was an image-based social analytics platform that harnessed AI to provide fresh insights on the usage and lifecycle of images shared on social media. The goal of this platform was to understand the complex trends of images spread across a multitude of social media websites, mainly with the appeal to plan and track the effectiveness of image-based marketing and logos.

The platform was built around our image analysis engine built for Danqex (formerly known as Nasdanq), a gamified stock market based on the popularity of internet trends. Danqex was featured in multiple online publications such as [CNET](https://www.cnet.com/news/memes-are-serious-business-with-their-own-stock-exchange/) and [The Verge](https://www.theverge.com/2017/1/10/14223264/meme-economy-reddit-stock-market).
