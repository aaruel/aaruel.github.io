# [Rockstar Music](https://rockstarmusic.ca/)

##### Role: Full Stack Developer

---

The Rockstar Music website is a business page meant for scheduling music lessons. It was contracted to me and a partner specifically to overhaul the frontend and backend to make the site much more customizable without any code changes, as well as improve SEO and performance. To do so we used Next.js, a server-side rendered React framework, to increase performance and customizability when combined with a custom built administration system to add or remove instructors, classes, programs, etc. To improve SEO, the client provided a company which analyzed the site and gave suggestions on what to modify to get maximum traffic from search engine results.
