##### Role: Student

---

The Serpent Cipher is a lesser known symmetric key encryption algorithm that was created for the NIST Advanced Encryption Standard competition. For a final project, I used the available paper on the cipher to recreate it in VHDL across the three typical stages of digital design: behavioral, dataflow, and structural. C was used to fully understand the complexity of the cipher, then was translated down to sequential VHDL components driven by the clock to move data through each stage of encryption and decryption. Learning how to apply iterative design was the biggest takeaway from this project.
