##### Role: Creator

Forge is the working title for a voxel-based city building game made from scratch in C++ and OpenGL. Multiple libraries come together to provide LuaJIT scripting, a GUI layer, noise generation, dependency injection, model loading, linear algebra, voxel polygonization, and physics. Rendering is done through the programmable shader pipeline, incorporating concepts such as deferred rendering, shadows, multiple light types, and Cook Torrance BRDF.
