# Warfighter Smartwatch

##### Role: Software Team Lead

---

The Warfighter Smartwatch is an ongoing senior project led by [Dr. Chunsheng Xin](https://www.odu.edu/directory/people/c/cxin) and [Dr. Lee Belfore](https://www.odu.edu/directory/people/l/lbelfore) designed to be a health monitoring wrist attachment that communicates sensor-detected vitals of the wearer wirelessly to any available smartphone. The project required a PCB design and hardware team to facilitate the embedded system that would be worn, and a software team to develop the smartphone application. 

The smartphone application was implemented as a Bluetooth receiver for the smartwatch Bluetooth transmitter, leveraging the Flutter mobile framework not only for frontend development, but also for creating a unified API for cross-platform interactivity (Android and iPhone), specifically useful for Bluetooth functionality. The application was also capable of logging data into a daily calendar and monitoring the incoming sensor data for any health emergencies.
